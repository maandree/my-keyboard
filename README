My customised Swedish keyboard layout


FEATURES:
• xterm compatible, Emacs is better if it thinks you are using xterm
• switch to any of the 63 VT:s
• swapped left control with caps lock
• swapped left alternative with less
• circumflex and titles are dead
• control+shift+[a-z] as alternative to meta+[a-z], for some reason C-S-x does not work
• mapped meta+shift+[0-9]
• mapped alt+control+[left|right] to control+x,[left|right]
• mapped right supper to home
• mapped menu to end
• mapped shift+left super to compose (sysreq is still also compose)
• control, shift, control+shift support for up,left,right,down
• some support for o[control|shift|control+shift]+[home|end]
• mapped meta+page[up|down], scrolls next buffer in Emacs
• mapped altgr+shift+less to slash
• heavier use of [shift +] alt graph
