My customised Swedish keyboard layout


FEATURES:

• xterm compatible, Emacs is better if it thinks you are using xterm

• switch to any of the 63 VT:s

• swapped left control with caps lock

• swapped left alternative with less

• circumflex and titles are dead

• control+shift+[a-z] as alternative to meta+[a-z]

• mapped meta+shift+[0-9]
